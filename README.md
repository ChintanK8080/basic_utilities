My Testing Package This is a private and deletable package that I created for testing purposes. It does not do anything useful, but it can be used to test the publishing and installation of private packages on pub.dev.

Installation To install this package, you will need to have the Flutter SDK installed. Once you have the Flutter SDK installed, you can install the package by running the following command:

pub add my_testing_package

Usage This package does not have any public APIs, so it cannot be used in your Flutter projects. However, you can use it to test the publishing and installation of private packages on pub.dev.

Contributing This package is not currently accepting contributions.

License This package is licensed under the MIT License.

You can customize this README.md file to fit your specific needs. For example, you can add more information about the features of your package, or you can add instructions on how to use the package in your Flutter projects.
